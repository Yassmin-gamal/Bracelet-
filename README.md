My graduation project is titled "Drowning People Detection and Rescue Using Computer Vision and Sensors." It consists of three main parts. 

In the first part, we focus on object detection to identify people in distress during drowning incidents. Using computer vision techniques, we aim to accurately detect and locate individuals in water.

The second part involves the development of a bracelet equipped with a Max30102 sensor. This sensor enables us to detect drowning individuals by monitoring their vital signs, such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. Additionally, the bracelet includes an inflatable device that can be activated to keep the person afloat. In case of an emergency, an alarm is sent to the lifeguard for immediate action.

The third part of our project involves the use of a drone for rescue operations. The drone is designed to swiftly reach the location of a drowning person and deliver a floating device to keep them afloat. Simultaneously, an alarm is sent to the lifeguard to alert them of the situation.

By integrating computer vision, sensors, and drone technology, our project aims to enhance the detection and rescue process for drowning individuals, ultimately saving lives and improving water safety.
