  Using XGBoost algorithm to detect the rapid Increase in heart rate indicating a panic attack and also detecting the decreasing slope of the heart ï»¿rate and oxygen in the blood. We covered two possible scenarios in drowning - struggling and obscured and fainting undetected. We covered two possible scenarios in drowning - struggling and obscured and fainting undetected. We used pulse oximeter sensor MAX30102 to measure Vital signs, and we used Raspberry pi pico microcontroller to run the algorithm of the detection and open the inflatable device for helping the victim.
